/**
 * A JUnit 5 [Extension] that allows you to test and control [Composable]s and application using Compose.
 * The functionality of testing Compose is provided by means of the [runComposeTest] method,
 * which receives a [ComposeContext] from which the test can be orchestrated. The test will block
 * until the app or composable is idle, to ensure the tests are deterministic.
 *
 * This extension can be added to any JUnit 5 class using the [ExtendWith] annotation,
 * or registered globally through a configuration file. Alternatively, you can instantiate the extension
 * in a field within the test class using any of the [createComposeExtension] or
 * [createAndroidComposeExtension] factory methods.
